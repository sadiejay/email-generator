## My process
- Built out basic HTML structure
- Added rough logic with vanilla js
  - JS logic is becoming a little easier for me. However, I can see where some for loops could be useful.
    - my first iteration I'm creating p tags in HTML for each output variation, when I would like to let js add different nodes within a div tag by intaking the 3 possible parameters then running through all of the outputs and displaying within the screen.
    - but I want to get it to work first then I'll go back and clean it up.
    - Second interation I used `createElement` which reduces the amount of hard coding needed!
- Next steps:
  - Combine all of the functions in a big one?
  - Figure out the reload situation
    - react? ðŸ‘€
  - Add some design elements
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- JS


### What I learned


- `createElement()` and `appendChild`
- It's ok to iterate!!
  - hard coding the p tags first then using js to dynamically render the inputs allowed me to continue progressing on the project as opposed to getting overwhelmed and giving up.

  #### code snippets


### Continued development

- I think this could be a nice simple project for react or svelte as well.
  - I would like a panel that shows the last 10 outputs
    - That could use the
  - A form that would allow bulk inputs.
    - That sounds like the inputs would directly populate an array. Then for each through the array and map (maybe) the outputs and display them.

- I'd love to figure out how to validate the emails before leaving this page.
  - I'm thinking it's some sort of API?

- Needs some design attention

- [Document.createElement() MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement) - I know it's possible to create a node and then append which I think I could do with some logic.
